","The emissions were caused by the sudden, unavoidable breakdown of equipment or process that was beyond the owner/operator's control, and  did not stem from activity that could have been foreseen and avoided, and could not have been avoided by good design, operation, and maintenance practices.  An electrical storm in the area knocked out power to the plant shutting down all engines and turbines.  With the engines and turbines down, inlet gas had to be flared.  Additionally the plant lost ability to control H2S so the plant went sour and gas had to be flared until the H2S was in acceptable range for transferring to customers.","Action was taken to achieve compliance at the time of discovery.  Once plant's power was restored, Operations verified that the plant could be operated safety and restarted the plant.

","On 08/23/17 at approximately 2332 hours Central Standard Time (CST) the TMPA Gibbons Creek unit experienced a unit trip due to ground fault on the “A” Primary Air (PA) fan.  The “A” PA fan will be out until the issue is resolved.  Following the purge the igniters restored fire in the boiler at 0052 hours CST on 08/24/17 using just the “B” PA fan. Immediately after the trip, the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) was taken out of service until a purge of combustible gasses could be completed to protect the equipment and for personnel safety. The ESP captures dust emissions before they exit the stack. The ESP was placed back in to service at 0102 hours CST. From 2336 hours through 2347 hours two (2) apparent reportable exceedances of the opacity standard were recorded by the COMs in the ducts (51.3 and 46.5). One (1) additional apparent non-reportable exceedance of the standard occurred from 0100 hours through 0105 hours (23.0) on 08/24/2017. During the start-up a second unit trip occurred at 0430 hours CST due to loss of the warm-up guns.  Following this trip, from 0448 hours through 0459 hours two (2) additional apparent reportable exceedances of the standard occurred (70.2 and 49.9). One (1) additional apparent non-reportable exceedance of the standard occurred from 0530 hours through 0535 hours (25.3). The wet scrubber remained in service throughout the incident and was removing particulates from flue gas downstream of the COM. The unit was back online by 0600 hours CST on 08/24/2017.   NOTE:  TMPA experienced STEERS password problems which did not allow for submission via STEERS during the required 24 hour period.  Therefore this report was initially submitted via e-mail to Jason Neuman and Jessica Gabler of TCEQ Waco at 1822 hours central daylight time on 8/24/2017.",NA,NA,FALSE

","On 08/27/17 at approximately 1253 hours Central Standard Time (CST) the TMPA Gibbons Creek unit experienced a unit trip due to a ‘low pressure trip’ in the boiler.  Several subsequent trips followed.  Immediately after the trip, the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) was taken out of service until a purge of combustible gasses could be completed to protect the equipment and for personnel safety. The ESP captures dust emissions before they exit the stack. The purge was initiated at 1540 CST. The ESP was placed back in service following the completion of the purge although subsequent trips necessitated taking it out of service again. From 1300 hours through 1305 hours one (1) apparent reportable exceedance of the opacity standard was recorded by the COMs in the ducts (73.8). One (1) additional apparent non-reportable exceedance of the standard occurred from 1306 hours through 1311 hours (31.7) on 08/27/2017. Later there were additional periods of apparent reportable exceedances of the opacity standard from 1430 through 1435 hours (39.6), 1524 hours through 1541 hours (39.1, 40.5, 42.1), 1618 hours through 1623 hours (38.6), 2130 through 2135 hours (63.2), 2254 through 2259 hours (49.1), and 2336 hours through 2341 hours (46.6).

","On 08/28/17 at approximately 1259 hours Central Standard Time (CST) the TMPA Gibbons Creek unit experienced a unit trip due to a Burner Management System ‘auto trip’ related to an imbalance of combustion airflow.  Immediately after the trip, the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) was taken out of service until a purge of combustible gasses could be completed to protect the equipment and for personnel safety. The ESP captures dust emissions before they exit the stack. The ESP was placed back in service following the completion of the purge. From 1312 hours through 1323 hours two (2) apparent reportable exceedances of the opacity standard was recorded by the COMs in the ducts (66.1, 37.2). The unit was back online by 1412 hours CST. The wet scrubber remained in service throughout the incident and was removing particulates from flue gas downstream of the COM.",NA,NA,FALSE

Flaring was used to minimize emissions. Flares were properly operated. (5) How soon was action taken to achieve compliance once the operator knew or should have known that applicable emission limitations were being exceeded? Once the control panel shut the compressor down gas was immediately routed to the flare (6) How were the amount and duration of the unauthorized emissions and any bypass of pollution control equipment minimized? Emissions were minimized by use of a flare. The flare is the control device, functioned properly, and there was no pollution control equipment bypass. (7) What was the operational status of all emission monitoring systems at the facility/facilities during this emissions event? If any emission monitoring systems were not kept in operation during the emissions event, explain why they weren’t kept in operation. No monitoring systems are required for this site. Field gas production from this site was diverted to the flare and the flare remained ignited until the pressures dropped below the rated pressures for the equipment at this site.

Discuss any sudden breakdown of equipment or process that was beyond the owner/operator’s control, if applicable MAIN COMPRESSOR DOWN AT PLANT AND WAS NOT ABLE TO ACCEPT ALL OUR PRODUCED GAS.  FLARING WAS USED TO MINIMIZE EMISSIONS.(4) How were the air pollution control equipment or processes (if any) maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions and reducing the number of emissions events? Flaring was used to minimize emissions. Flares were properly operated. (5) How soon was action taken to achieve compliance once the operator knew or should have known that applicable emission limitations were being exceeded? Once the control panel shut the compressor down gas was immediately routed to the flare (6) How were the amount and duration of the unauthorized emissions and any bypass of pollution control equipment minimized? Emissions were minimized by use of a flare. The flare is the control device, functioned properly, and there was no pollution control equipment bypass. (7) What was the operational status of all emission monitoring systems at the facility/facilities during this emissions event? If any emission monitoring systems were not kept in operation during the emissions event, explain why they weren’t kept in operation. No monitoring systems are required for this site. Field gas production from this site was diverted to the flare and the flare remained ignited until the pressures dropped below the rated pressures for the equipment at this site. (8) How were the owner or operator’s actions in response to the unauthorized emissions contemporaneously documented? The TCEQ STEERS reporting system was used to provide initial notice of the event.

","Third party electrical provider was conducting maintenance on incoming electric feed line to the East Plant Facility.  The third-party provider had constructed an electric by-pass (jumper) to continue uninterrupted service during the maintenance of the electric feed line.  This bypass malfunctioned during the maintenance activity causing the East Plant to lose purchase power.  When purchase power is lost, the facility shuts down and inlet gas normally processed by the facility is routed to the flare for safety reasons.","The East Plant facility processes low pressure gas from natural gas producers.  This low pressure gas is sent to the facility by the use of natural gas compressor stations.  Enlink began lowwering the amount of natural gas entering the East Plant to minimize the flaring of natural gas.  The East Plant is rated at 100 million standard cubic feet (MMSCF) per day.  The actions initiated by East Plant minimized the amount of gas that was flared to approximately 10 MMSCF/day.","Visible observations for the opacity event (non Method 9 or 22), and company-developed emission estimation worksheets.",TRUE
